# Lifecycle management of service meshes
Meshery supports a number of [different service meshes](installation/adapters), so that you can learn and compare different service mesh functionality. Once you have selected to operate a given service mesh, Meshery will assist you with ongoing activities.

## Deleting a service mesh
Meshery automates the provisioning of various service meshes, allowing users to select different configuration profiles in order to support a variety of deployment models.

## Installing sample applications
Commonly adjoining each service mesh is a sample application that facilitates demonstration of the value of the given service mesh. Meshery allows you to quickly deploy the same sample application across different service meshes.

## Use custom service mesh configuration
Meshery provides the ability for you as a service mesh manager to customize your service mesh deployment.

## Deleting a service mesh
Just as Meshery automates the provisioning of various service meshes, so does it faciliate the deprovisioning of service meshes.

# Notifications 
Meshery tracks service mesh and application health. Meshery provides notification of environment issues, application conflicts with service mesh configuration.
