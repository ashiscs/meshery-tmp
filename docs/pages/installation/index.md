# Quick Start 
Getting Meshery up and running on a locally on Docker-enabled system is easy. Use the Meshery command line interface, `mesheryctl`, to start Meshery on any of its [supported platforms](#compatibility-matrix).

### Using Docker on Mac or Linux
**Homebrew**
1. Download `mesheryctl` and install Meshery on Docker on Mac or Linux with homebrew:

```
brew tap layer5io/tap
brew install mesheryctl
mesheryctl start
```

**Bash**
1. Download `meshery` and install Meshery on Docker on Mac or Linux with homebrew:

```
curl -L https://git.io/meshery | bash -
```

### Using Docker on Windows
1. Visit [Meshery releases](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/releases/latest), download and unzip the `mesheryctl` utility. Add `mesheryctl` to your PATH for ease of use.

```
./mesheryctl start
```

2. Upon starting Meshery successfully, instructions to access Meshery will be printed on the sceen.

## What is `mesheryctl`?
`mesheryctl` is a command line interface to manage a Meshery deployment. `mesheryctl` allows you to control Meshery's lifecycle with commands like `start`, `stop`, `status`, `cleanup`. Running `cleanup` will remove all active container instanaces, prune pulled images and remove any local volumes crated by starting Meshery.
